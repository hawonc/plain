% function [known, unknown] = VaryUserInputs(Aircraft)
% GPR pre-processing function
% Written by Maxfield Arnson
%
% This low level function is called while preprocessing user inputs before
% they are sized by main and EAPAnalysis. Based on a user input file, it
% decides which fields are independent and dependent variables for the
% Gaussian process regression.
%
%
% INPUTS:
% Aircraft = the structure defined by the user after running an
%   initialization function, such as ERJ175LR()
%
%
% OUTPUTS:
% known = structure with subfields
%   names = names of independent variables as they appear in the aircraft
%       database
%   values = numerical values of the independent variables
%
% unknown = names of dependent variables as they appear in the aircraft
%   database
