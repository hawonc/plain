% (I) Overview
%
%       The Battery Package is used to model battery (dis)charging in
%       FAST's mission analysis and is also responsible for re-sizing the
%       battery in an aircraft. This package is only run when a number of
%       cells in series and in parallel are provided via 
%       "Aircraft.Specs.Power.Battery.SerCells" and
%       "Aircraft.Specs.Power.Battery.ParCells". An initial battery
%       state-of-charge (SOC) is also required by including a double
%       between 0 and 100 in "Aircraft.Specs.Power.Battery.BegSOC".

% (II) Warning
%
%       This package contains information that is essential to FAST's
%       functionality, and should not be altered by end users.
